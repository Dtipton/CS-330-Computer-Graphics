How do I approach designing software?
What new design skills has your work on the project helped you to craft?
What design process did you follow for your project work?

I like to gather requirements and try and seperate my program into smaller chunks ( like in this project getting the window to draw, then focus on getting the shaders working).
I think this project for sure helped me hone in my troubleshooting skills. I don't think I've ever had to do so much troubleshooting weather it be setting up opengl or trying setup a 3rd party libary for the first time.


How could tactics from your design approach be applied in future work?
How do I approach developing programs?
What new development strategies did you use while working on your 3D scene?
How did iteration factor into your development?
How has your approach to developing code evolved throughout the milestones, which led you to the projectâ€™s completion?

I think having a better understanding on how graphics are built on a pc will help me better understand how to make sure any graphics are as efficient as possible.
I like to approach programmign with Test Driven Development in mind. This allows me to make sure I'm testing as I'm going along.
I made a big use of the debug tool with this course which ive never used much in the past.
My approach for sure altered as the course went on. I started with a very basic design and quickly shifted to a model loader which really put me back and cost me
a lot of valuable time to get running.



How can computer science help me in reaching my goals?
How do computational graphics and visualizations give you new knowledge and skills that can be applied in your future educational pathway?
How do computational graphics and visualizations give you new knowledge and skills that can be applied in your future professional pathway?

Computer science allows me to have a better fundemental grasp on theroy and appplicaton of many different types of technologies and uses for programming.
Computer graphics and visualizations will help me better understand how computers work at a low level and will help as I futher go into my next few courses such as CS-350 and 
CS-405

This course also gives me a veiw into how professional graphics are built ( and in particular video games), My company actually has a graphics department that renders jewels in real time off a custom built engine. So this course could potentially lead me toward a new position.
